Youtube didn't include a keyboard shortcut to go to the latest part of a live youtube braodcast.
I mainly use this when viewing gaming streams. It works by searching for the aria-label 'skip ahead to live broadcast' which is unique currently.

Currently uses Command+Shift+P for Mac, but you can modify the button in the mainfest.json or go to chrome://extensions/shortcuts after installing.

To install:

1. Clone this project.
2. going to Chrome's Manage Extesions page (or chrome://extensions/)
3. Enable Developer Mode
4. Load unpacked -> select the cloned directory
